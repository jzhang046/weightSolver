# weightSolver
A GUI developed using matlab to solve the takeoff weight. Used for aircraft design.

There are still some space of improvements, including change a fixed mission profile to a full-editble list of missions.
Due to time limitations, I have not implemented that. :(

#vnDiagram
A function to plot V-N diagram with gusts. 

#emContour
A script to plot EM contour diagrams, and plot that of T-38 to compare. 


Notice that all the functions would need atoms.m to work, for atmospheric properties.
